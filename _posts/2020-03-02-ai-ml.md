Artificial Intelligence refers to making computers behave intelligently. Computers, who are not capable of intelligent behavior on their own, are made to simulate intelligent behavior using some algorithm.

Behind all AI robots/computers, there is an algorithm that makes it look that way. AI is a broad field that encompasses all such algorithms, including hard-coded rules to simulate intelligence.

Machine Learning is a subfield of AI. Here, we try to make the machine learn by itself. Naturally, there is an algorithm involved, but here, instead of telling the computer what to look for, you tell it how to learn. There are no hard-coded rules. We do not use the computer just to speed up something we do, or to memorize a bunch of rules that we cannot. Instead, the machine simulates "learning" on the given "data".

Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning. It is to do with Neural Networks, algorithms that are inspired by the human brain.
