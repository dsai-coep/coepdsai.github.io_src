Artificial Intelligence refers to making computers behave intelligently. Computers, who are not capable of intelligent behavior on their own, are made to simulate intelligent behavior using some algorithm.

Behind all AI robots/computers, there is an algorithm that makes it look that way. AI is a broad field that encompasses all such algorithms, including hard-coded rules to simulate intelligence.

Machine Learning is a subfield of AI. Here, we try to make the machine learn by itself. Naturally, there is an algorithm involved, but here, instead of telling the computer what to look for, you tell it how to learn. There are no hard-coded rules. We do not use the computer just to speed up something we do, or to memorize a bunch of rules that we cannot. Instead, the machine simulates "learning" on the given "data".

Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning. It is to do with Neural Networks, algorithms that are inspired by the human brain.

## Linear Regression From Scratch

Linear Regression is among the simplest Machine Learaning algorithms, which can be used to fit a line through a set of points giving the least error. 

In this lecture, we code logistic regression from scratch. We delve into the basic concepts of backpropagation and use NumPy to first code a stochastic version, and then code the vectorized version of Logistic Regression.

That's all for our Introductory series on Machine Learning with Python! [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a great platform to experiment with datasets and gain hands on practice with ML techniques, so I encourage you to create a Kaggle account and start applying ML methods to real datasets!
