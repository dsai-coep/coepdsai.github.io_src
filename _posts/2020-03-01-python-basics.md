Python is high-level programming language, making coding progranms very easy and intuitive. The availability of a plethora of well-sipported libraries make it one of the most popular programming languages today.

For most Machine learning applications, Python is an essential skill that needs to be mastered before learning to develop any ML applications. This blog contains links to 2 separate formats of explanation: a Juppyter Notebook and a video containing a walkthrough of the Jupyter notebook. Feel free to look at whichever format suits you best.

## An introduction into Python
This lecture covers the basics of Python. Topics covered are:
<ul>
    <li>Variables and Datatypes
    <li>Operators
    <li>Collection Data Types(Lists, Strings, Sets, Dictionaries, Tuples)
    <li>The if statement
    <li>For loops
    <li>Nested Loops
    <li>While loops
    <li>continue and break
</ul>

## Important ML Libraries in Python (NumPy, Pandas and ScikitLearn)

This lecture covers the basics of NumPy, Pandas and SciKit Learn, 3 of the most popular libraries for Machine Learning in Python.
Topics covered include:
<ul>
    <li>Numpy:
    <ul>
        <li>Datatypes
        <li>Functions
        <li>Operations
        <li>Indexing
    </ul>
    <li>Pandas:
    <ul>
        <li>Series
        <li>DataFrame
        <li>Indexing
        <li>Functions
    </ul>
    <li>Walkthrough of the Iris Dataset using ScikitLearn.
</ul>
